### 《Rubber Soul》

#### In My Life

```
[Verse 1]
There are places I'll remember
All my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

[Verse 2]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 3]
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

In my life I love you more
```

### 《Revolver》

#### Yellow Submarine

```
[Verse 1]
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

[Verse 2]
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

[Chorus]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Verse 3]
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

[Chorus]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Bridge]
Full speed ahead, Mr. Parker, full speed ahead
Full speed over here, sir
Action station, action station
Aye, aye, sir, fire
Heaven, heaven

[Verse 4]
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need (has all we need)
Sky of blue (sky of blue) and sea of green (and sea of green)
In our (In our) yellow submarine (yellow submarine, ha-ha!)

[Chorus]
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
```

### 《Abbey Road》

#### Come Together

```
[Intro: John Lennon]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Here come old flat-top, he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Shoot me, shoot me
Right!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4: John Lennon]
He roller-coaster, he got early warnin'
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good-lookin' 'cause he's so hard to see

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Come together, right now
Over me

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me, shoot me
Ugh!

[Outro: John Lennon]
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
[Fade-out]
Come together, yeah
Come together...
```

#### Something

```
[Verse 1]
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Bridge]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
```
#### Here Comes the Sun

```
[Intro]
Here comes the sun (doo doo doo doo)
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 1]
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 2]
Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Bridge]
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

[Verse 3]
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Outro]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right
```

### 《Let It Be》

#### Across the Universe

```
[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on, across the universe

[Chorus: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

[Outro: John Lennon]
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
```
